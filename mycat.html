<h2>My Cat</h2>
<p>Seven years ago, I visited an auto shop to fix my crumpled car bumper…but left with something far better.
    The shop owner had rescued a stray cat who’d just given birth to a litter of tiny, squeaky kittens.
    “Take one,” he offered. The moment I saw him among the seven kittens, I knew he was mine.
    And that’s how Bumper—the cat who “crashed” into my life—became my forever co-pilot.</p>
