            <h2>Harbin</h2>
            <p>My hometown, Harbin, wears winter like a crown—snow lingers for six months, turning streets into rivers of white. Yet its people melt the cold with warmth as rich as stews simmering on stoves.
                At 18, I left its ice-sculpted horizons and the laughter echoing through Central Street, carrying memories of frost-kissed mornings and roasted chestnut aromas. </p>

            <h2>Guangzhou</h2>
            <p>At 18, I traded Harbin’s snow-laden skies for Guangzhou’s sun-drenched streets, where banyan trees cradle neon-lit nights and the Pearl River hums with tropical whispers. 
                Between skyscrapers and ancient temples, I’ve woven friendships as vibrant as the silk markets, friends' laughter dissolving the ache of homesickness. </p>

            <h2>Dallas</h2>
            <p>Dallas sprawls beneath endless Texan skies—a mosaic of steel skyscrapers, smoky barbecue pits, and sunburned prairies where "y’all" rings louder than subway trains. 
                During my time here for my master's degree, I relearned the world: accents bent like highway curves, friendships forged over rodeo nights and spicy chili, and a culture where resilience wears cowboy boots.</p>

            <h2>Tuscaloosa</h2>
            <p>Tuscaloosa, a city of unassuming charm, cradles the roaring heart of Alabama, where the Black Warrior River whispers history and Bryant-Denny Stadium thunders with the legacy of the Crimson Tide. 
                Beneath its sleepy Southern grace lies a fervor for football that paints autumn skies scarlet, and a quiet tenacity that fuels dreams. 
                Here, amid tailgate smoke and library lamplight, I carved my name into academia’s ledger, my resolve mirroring the Tide’s relentless surge. 
                This small city, with its giant spirit, taught me that even the humblest soil can nurture greatness.</p>

<h2>My Cat</h2>
<p>Seven years ago, I visited an auto shop to fix my crumpled car bumper…but left with something far better.
    The shop owner had rescued a stray cat who’d just given birth to a litter of tiny, squeaky kittens.
    “Take one,” he offered. The moment I saw him among the seven kittens, I knew he was mine.
    And that’s how Bumper—the cat who “crashed” into my life—became my forever co-pilot.</p>
