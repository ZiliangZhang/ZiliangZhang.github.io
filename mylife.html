            <h2>Harbin</h2>
            <p>My hometown, Harbin, wears winter like a crown—snow lingers for six months, turning streets into rivers of white. Yet its people melt the cold with warmth as rich as stews simmering on stoves.
                At 18, I left its ice-sculpted horizons and the laughter echoing through Central Street, carrying memories of frost-kissed mornings and roasted chestnut aromas. </p>

<h2>My Cat</h2>
<p>Seven years ago, I visited an auto shop to fix my crumpled car bumper…but left with something far better.
    The shop owner had rescued a stray cat who’d just given birth to a litter of tiny, squeaky kittens.
    “Take one,” he offered. The moment I saw him among the seven kittens, I knew he was mine.
    And that’s how Bumper—the cat who “crashed” into my life—became my forever co-pilot.</p>
